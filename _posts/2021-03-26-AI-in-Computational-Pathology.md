This article provides an overview of Computational Pathology and its applications in the field of cancer diagnosis. It emphasizes the importance of early cancer detection and staging for effective treatment planning. The article explains that Whole Slide Images (WSIs) are essential for cancer diagnosis and staging, and outlines the process of generating WSIs through digitization. The Computational Pathology Workflow involves data acquisition, image analysis, computer-aided diagnosis, and survival study. Image analysis involves identifying different types of cells and digital biomarkers specific to each type of cancer. Computer-aided diagnosis assists pathologists in decision-making and disease assessment, while survival study predicts patient survival using regression-based survival analysis models.
