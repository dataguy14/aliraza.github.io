The article discusses the increasing size of deep learning models and the need for distributed computing in training these models. It explains the concepts of nodes, world size, local rank, and global rank in distributed computing. The article then provides a step-by-step guide to building a PyTorch training pipeline using a standalone script, DataParallel, and DistributedDataParallel. It includes code snippets for each approach and explains the necessary changes to enable training on multiple GPUs. The article also highlights best practices for optimizing training pipelines, such as using mixed precision, optimizing data loaders, and increasing batch size.
