This article provides a step-by-step guide for setting up PyTorch and TensorFlow, popular deep learning frameworks, on a Windows machine. While Linux is commonly used for deep learning due to extensive online support, this article aims to simplify the process for Windows users. The setup process includes four main steps: installing the Nvidia driver, installing Anaconda, installing the CUDA driver, and installing the deep learning frameworks. The article explains each step in detail, including how to identify and install the appropriate drivers and how to install TensorFlow and PyTorch using pip or Anaconda. The article also provides code snippets to verify the successful installation of the frameworks and GPU compatibility.
