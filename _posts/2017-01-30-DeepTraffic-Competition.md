A Deep Reinforcement Learning problem of a Self-driving car was opened as a competiton. 

Registered people had to make changes in the given Network so that it can achieve max avergae speed in MPH. 

In version 1.0 I reached to 10th position by getting help from different sources and using my basic Deep RL knowledge so far. 

The best part was looking at [Convnetjs](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/) which is made for practising Deep Learning and RL algorithms by the power of javascript inside browser without Linux or GPU support. 

For the code [here](https://github.com/AizazSharif/DeepTraffic-Competition) is the repository.
