The article discusses the challenges faced by Deep Learning practitioners in setting up CUDA-enabled TensorFlow/PyTorch for new projects and proposes using Docker as a solution. Docker is an open-source containerization platform that allows developers to package applications into containers, combining source code with the necessary libraries and dependencies. Docker Hub provides a portal to search for various Docker Images, including Nvidia-Docker2, TensorFlow (GPU/CPU Versions), and PyTorch (GPU/CPU). The article then provides step-by-step instructions for installing Nvidia drivers, Docker, and Nvidia-Docker2. It also demonstrates how to run a TensorFlow Docker container and check if the GPU is available inside the container. Docker simplifies the setup process and saves time for Deep Learning practitioners.
