The goal of the project is to perform localization using input images on a given set of reference imagery. In addition, this solution had to be lightweight so that it can be deployed on edge devices. The stack used in this project is Python, PyTorch, OpenCV, Scikit-Image, and Pandas. I was responsible for performing R&D, data preparation, writing unit tests, building the matching pipeline and deployment to NVIDIA Jetson Development kit.
