The goal of this project is to build a mobile app that can take a photograph of a baseball card and identify the baseball card from a database of baseball cards. Once matching is complete, all the metadata of the baseball card is to be returned to the end-user. The Machine Learning part consists of database that will contain all the extracted features from the final layer of the images of baseball cards and a similarity search feature that will take input an image, create its features by running a forward pass from the model then returns the results (of most similar card from database) of that card. The stack used for this project was Python, PyTorch and Android App. I was involved in training and developing the matching algorithm. Additionally, I collaborated with the mobile application team for APIs for communication of mobile applications with the machine learning backend.
