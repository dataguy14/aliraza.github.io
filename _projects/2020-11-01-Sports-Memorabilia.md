The goal of this project was to transform the existing reporting system which consists of manual data extraction, report creation, and data sharing in [CCL](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ccl-pharmaceuticals). I proposed the transformation strategy and developed state-of-the-art BI pipeline from data extraction to the report sharing. Under the supervision of [Dr. Shahzad Khan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shahzad-khan-14372226) and [Syed Iftikhar Hashmi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/farhan-hashmi-72705627). 

I adopted [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-pk) stack and integrated data sources like [IQVIA datasets](https://www.linkedin.com/company/iqvia), marketing & sales, Human Resources, and Finance using SSIS. Then created the tabular model in SSAS and used [Power BI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-bi) for data visualization. 

For automated data sharing, I configured the set of reports in Power BI service and schedule the refresh intervals and set the subscriptions for scheduled data sharing with the top management. 
The CEO Dr. Shahzad Khan acknowledged that my reporting system helped him to make informed decisions by presenting [Value appreciation card (VAC)](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dataguy-ali_bisuccessstories-bianalyst-ccl-activity-7234109955044204544-5T8y?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) 

*The CEO remarked as "For creating a set of reports/information which helped me in making agile decisions."* CCL gained record growth, highest in the history. 

As I see it, **when we approach our work with a business mindset, treating our roles as if we're running our own companies, we unlock the potential for extraordinary contributions.**
