**Goal:** To streamline incident data management by ensuring accurate metadata entry, minimizing errors, and enabling real-time insights to highlight high-risk areas for improvement.\
**Challenges:** The existing system relied on direct metadata entry into Google Sheets without field validation, leading to frequent human errors. Fields that could be calculated were manually entered, historical data exploration was cumbersome, and there was no live reporting mechanism.\
**Approach:**\
**Improving Data Entry Process:** Implemented field validation to ensure accurate data entry and reduced manual input by introducing calculated fields, minimizing human errors.
**Historical Data Cleanup:** Identified and corrected errors in historical data to ensure consistency and reliability.\
**Live Reporting:** Designed and implemented a live reporting system to provide real-time insights, making it easier to track incidents and highlight high-risk areas.\
**Granular Insights:** Enabled analysis at multiple levels, including area-specific and nature-specific breakdowns, to identify and address improvement opportunities.\
**Impact:** The project significantly streamlined data entry, reducing time and error rates while enhancing the reliability of incident reporting. Decision-makers gained easy access to insights, enabling them to pinpoint high-risk areas and implement targeted improvements. This initiative transformed incident metadata management into a more efficient and actionable process, driving operational excellence.\
**This project showcases my ability to address data management challenges, implement robust solutions, and deliver actionable insights that enhance organizational performance.**
