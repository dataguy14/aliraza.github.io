The goal of this project is to raise alarms if certain rules are being violated in the working environments. These working environments are mostly on an oil drilling ship. Next, there was an addition of risk bots with an increase in the scope of the project. The data labeling is outsourced to AWS SageMaker and training is also being carried out on SageMaker. I was responsible for leading the development of a safety app which involved conducting R&D for various safety bots, creating safety app architecture, code reviews and collaboration with Machine Learning engineers related to safety app development.
