We developed a machine learning model that is able to classify the userâ€™s activities for various social media (Facebook, Instagram, Spotify, Youtube etc), music and lifestyle apps and generate highlights of those activities. The highlights were generated using the mobile screen recordings of a given user. A deep learning model was used to extract meaningful information. Highlights were saved in audio, video snippets, screenshots and photos format. The stack used for this project is Python, Tensorflow, OpenCV and AWS Cloud. I was responsible for building the architecture of a machine learning backend, assisting annotators with data labeling and managing machine learning engineers in developing APIs and pipelines.
