The focus of the project was to build an Interactive Dashboard for BCG Gammaâ€™s CO2 AI product. The dashboard was built using Dash which uses the Plotly library at the backend. The dashboard provided real-time updated and generated real-time results for Calculating Net Zero Pathways to achieve Net Zero Emissions (NZE). The stack used in this project is Python, Pandas, Dash, Plotly, AWS S3, and AWS EC2. I was responsible for gathering requirements, obtaining domain knowledge, data mapping, and assisting engineers in building dashboards from Figma Designs.
