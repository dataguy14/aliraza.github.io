A person's profile picture is their first impression to the world, be it social media or professional sites. We developed an AI model that's trained to generate avatars in 65+ styles tailored for men, women and couples. The model needs 15 close up shots in different clothes, expressions and backgrounds to generate 150+ unique avatars. I was responsible for developing a video animation module that generates videos using prompts and user input images.
