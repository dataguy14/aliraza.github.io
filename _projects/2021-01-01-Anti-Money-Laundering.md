The focus of the project was to develop an anti-money laundering system that is able to flag suspicious transactions. This system monitored historical data and monitored rules against peer groups which were the basis of Transaction Flagging. The stack used for this project was Python, Scikit-Learn and SQL. I conducted R&D, data gathering and model training using KYC data. The results of the trained model were then visualized using PowerBI.
